Privacy Policy:

As part of using VR Darts alpha, we collect absolutely no info so far.

In the future, we may store and use some informations to faciliate multiplayer.
1. your public and local IP address (and ports)
2. your multiplayer activity (who you play, scores, etc)
3. any logs you choose to send
4. your device type (quest/quest2...)

The data we share with other users as part of easily visible information:
1. your oculus account name.
2. your oculus avatar
3. your device type - as per the controller models rendered during multiplayer activity.

The data we share programmatically with others that could be pulled from logs:
1. your IP address; the only way to hide this completely from the other user would be to force relay functionality...
which is detrimental to the experience compared to p2p.

If at any time you would like to remove any stored data we may have regarding your activity, please send us a request at
